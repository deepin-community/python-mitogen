Using Mitogen for Ansible
=========================

The mitogen strategies are installed into the ansible strategy plugin
directory. So, all you need to do is select one of them.

Either:
1. Export ANSIBLE_STRATEGY=mitogen_linear, or
2. Add to your ansible.cfg:
   [defaults]
   strategy = mitogen_linear
